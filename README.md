4 Clases
Card =  keeps ranks and suits.
Deck = makes deck, has few methods, deal, draw etc. the last one in the class dosen't do anything. forgot to remove.
Main = starts the game
Hand =  checks for hand. This class keeps, table method, main play method, sorts out hand and change card method.

In general, game works, there is still so much more that can be done.

It looks like:
Shows payout table.
Shows cards.
Question - want to change your cards? yes / no
if (no) shows if your hand won something and asks you if you want to play again (yes / no)
if (yes) asks which card you would like to change, and that card is changed. Then asks if you want to change another card and if yes it changes it. Finnaly, if you dont want to change your cards it show you want your hand won and asks if you want to play again.
